# 🍻 Display
Tired of spending **3 hours** downloading plugins only for learning Japanese from shows?

***Then you're at the right place!!***

Display is a program designed to cut down the process of downloading a movie player, installing plugins
and setting every thing up right with Anki to watch downloaded Anime.

# ☕️ Introduction
Display will have many of the same kind of features many Netflix or Youtube language learning plugins have,
but then focused for downloaded content like anime.

With this program you will be able to smoothly connect to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), watch and make cards in a fly.
