## Features
<p style="white-space: pre;">
Display will have many of the same kind of features many Netflix or Youtube language learning plugins have,
but then focused for downloaded content like anime.

With this program you will be able to smoothly connect to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), watch and make cards in a fly.
